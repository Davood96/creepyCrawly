To Run, you need to have a php engine. Then, you need to run index.php on a local
server (I used XAMPP -> Apache)

Once Opened, you can enter the number of hits you desire
and select what to crawl: CNN or Tweets

If you don't wish to run, example output has been provided for 25 hits,
each for CNN and Twitter, executed on Dec 19th 2017 11:57 pm;
